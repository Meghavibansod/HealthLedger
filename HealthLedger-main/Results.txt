🎉 HealthLedger Project Complete!
Perfect! You've successfully built and tested a fully functional HealthLedger system on Polygon Amoy. Here's what we accomplished:

✅ What's Working
Smart Contract: Deployed on Polygon Amoy with role-based access control
Doctor Management: Added doctor role successfully
Health Records: Created, read, and updated patient records
Access Control: Granted permissions to doctors
IPFS Integration: Ready for real file uploads
Windows Compatibility: All scripts work with PowerShell
📊 Test Results
Record Created: patient-001 → 0xa5478d6ea0e5a36e150afd45006c957f8b73743c0ac8ff4f99cdabd3040fda86
CID Updated: QmTestHash123 → QmUpdatedHash456
